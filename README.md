# 🌊 SPONGEBOB EYE-MOVEMENT FUN

A playful website where SpongeBob characters follow your mouse cursor with their eyes! This project is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

## 💡 Idea

While applying for developer positions online, I came across this [company's website](https://www.volumental.com/employees) and was impressed by the way they implemented their employees page.

I made the decision to implement this feature by myself because I saw it as a challenge to test and improve my skills.

- **TypeScript**: Leverages TypeScript for a more robust and type-safe development experience.
